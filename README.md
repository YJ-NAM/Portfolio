# Portfolio
Still updating 


I mostly used HTML/CSS and a bit of JavaScript to create my Portfolio.
Making webpages using HTML/CSS was my first time, and it was a great experience.
I've learned that now I really can make something that works on the Internet like genuine developers.
I'm going to update this portfolio whenever there is something to upload.
Thank you for reading.

ps. If you have any questions on this, please let me know.
